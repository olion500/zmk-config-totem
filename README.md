## Keymap

### 🧩 Default Keymap

The default layout looks like the following:

<img width="956" height="1515" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e35df960-6e23-47d8-93d8-0d4563873e23" />


### 🔁 Restore Default Keymap

If your TOTEM did not ship with this firmware, or you want to restore the original layout:

👉 Download the firmware here:
[https://github.com/Keycoon/zmk-config-totem](https://github.com/Keycoon/zmk-config-totem)
(GitHub sign-in required)

Then follow **Step 7 (Flash)** below to install it.

## Customization

You can customize your TOTEM keyboard in two ways.

---

## 1) ZMK Studio — Easy Live Keymap Editing

ZMK Studio offers a visual editor for adjusting your keymap.

🔗 [https://zmk.studio](https://zmk.studio)

> ⚠️ ZMK Studio is still under development and does not support all ZMK features.
> For advanced customizations, use the method below.

---

## 2) Full Customization — Build & Flash Your Own Firmware

Use this method if you want full access to ZMK behaviors, advanced features, or deeper customization.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### **1. Create a GitHub Account (if you don’t have one)**

[https://github.com](https://github.com)

* GitHub is required to store your configuration and build firmware using GitHub Actions.

---

### **2. Fork the TOTEM Firmware Config Repository**

[https://github.com/Keycoon/zmk-config-totem](https://github.com/Keycoon/zmk-config-totem)

* Click **“Fork”** in the top-right corner
* This creates your own editable copy of the configuration repository

---

### **3. Open the Keymap Editor**

[https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/)

* Connect your GitHub account
* Select your forked repository

---

### **4. Edit Your Keymap**

* Modify layers, key bindings, and advanced ZMK behaviors
* Reference official ZMK documentation:
  [https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors](https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors)

---

### **5. Save Your Changes**

* Click **“Save”** at the top of the editor
* This will automatically trigger a firmware build through GitHub Actions

---

### **6. Download the Compiled Firmware**

* Go to your GitHub repository → **Actions** tab
* Open the latest workflow run
* Download the `.uf2` firmware files

(You can also use the download button in the editor.)

---

### **7. Flash the Firmware**

1. Connect the keyboard via USB-C
2. Double-press the reset button on the top side
3. A USB drive will appear on your device
4. Drag the appropriate `.uf2` file onto the drive
5. The keyboard will flash and reboot automatically

> Flashing the **left half** is usually enough.
> Flash both halves if certain changes don’t take effect.

## Local Build Environment (Nix + direnv + just)

This repo now ships the same Nix-based local build flow described in urob’s config. Quick start:

**Prerequisites**
* Nix (with flakes enabled)
* `direnv` (with the shell hook enabled)
* `just`

**Setup**
1) Allow the workspace: `direnv allow` (this will spin up the Nix shell; the first run takes a while).
2) Initialize the Zephyr workspace and modules: `just init`

**Build**
* Build all firmware targets from `build.yaml`: `just build all`
* Artifacts land in `firmware/` (e.g. `firmware/totem_left-xiao_ble.uf2` and `firmware/totem_right-xiao_ble.uf2`).
